Skynet Auto-Remediation Tool

This repository contains Puppet manifests for Skynet, an auto-remediation tool developed during my tenure at SlideShare. Skynet was designed to monitor, scale, and fix Cloud infrastructure, utilizing the MCollective parallel job-execution system.

Background Context
During the development of Skynet, a critical bug emerged in the code that led to unexpected consequences. A nil value was inadvertently sent to the filter method of MCollective, resulting in the following issues:

MCollective interpreted nil as 'all servers' for its filter method.
The action applied was to terminate the selected servers.
This oversight led to the inadvertent shutdown of 75% of SlideShare's conversion infrastructure servers, disrupting users' ability to convert PDFs, PowerPoints, and videos.

Fortunately, the use of Puppet enabled a swift restoration of the infrastructure within one hour. Manual recovery would have been a daunting task, involving launching servers, configuring and linking them, importing application code, starting processes, and addressing bugs.

For a humorous take on the incident, check out this tweet.
